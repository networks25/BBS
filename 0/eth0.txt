Telephony

Pulse-Code Modulation

* Analog voice signal sampled at 8kHz (8000 samples/second)
* Each sample is quantized into 7 or 8 bits using ADC

8000 x 7 = 5600 b/s or 56kb/s
8000 x 8 = 6400 b/s or 64kb/s

Nyquist-Shannon theorem

To faithfully reconstruct a signal, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency of the signal

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem

The human voice generally spans up to 4 kHz for intelligibility. Sampling at 8 kHz ensures accurate reconstruction.

Telephony still uses PCM for digital voice encoding, particularly the 64 kbps rate (8 bits Ã— 8000 Hz). However, modern systems (e.g., VoIP, 4G, 5G) often use compression codecs (e.g., G.711, G.729, Opus) to reduce bandwidth requirements while maintaining voice quality.

Frames in Ethernet

An Ethernet frame is a structured data unit used to transmit information between devices. It includes specific fields to ensure proper communication.
Structure of an Ethernet Frame

    Preamble (7 bytes):
        A sequence of alternating 1s and 0s used to synchronize communication between sender and receiver.

    Start Frame Delimiter (SFD, 1 byte):
        Indicates the beginning of the frame.

    Destination MAC Address (6 bytes):
        The unique address of the recipient device.

    Source MAC Address (6 bytes):
        The unique address of the sender device.

    Type/Length (2 bytes):
        Indicates either the protocol type (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) or the length of the payload.

    Payload/Data (46-1500 bytes):
        The actual data being transmitted (e.g., part of a web page or file).

    Frame Check Sequence (FCS, 4 bytes):
        Contains a checksum to detect transmission errors.

------------------

    Minimum size: 64 bytes (to avoid collision ambiguity).
    Maximum size: 1518 bytes (standard Ethernet) or higher with jumbo frames.


Ethernet/data link addressing

each interface has a MAC address, 48 bits.

IP: IPv4 address is 32bit
IPv6 address is 128bit


Address translation:

DNS

ARP


TCP/UDP segment has

port number: 16 bit
(imagine gates in the airport)

cat /etc/services
