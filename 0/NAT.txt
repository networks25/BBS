How NAT Works:

    Outbound Traffic (Private → Public):
        When a device in the private network (e.g., 192.168.1.100) sends a packet to the internet:
            The packet has:
                Source IP: The private IP (192.168.1.100).
                Source Port: A randomly chosen port (e.g., 54321).
                Destination IP: The public server’s IP (e.g., 93.184.216.34).
            The router performing NAT:
                Replaces the source IP (private) with its public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.1).
                Keeps track of this translation in a NAT table.
            The packet is sent out to the destination server.

    Inbound Traffic (Public → Private):
        When the server replies, it sends a packet back to the router’s public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.1) with:
            Destination Port: The port the router had assigned (54321).
        The router:
            Looks up its NAT table to see which internal (private) IP and port this packet was meant for.
            Translates the destination IP and port back to the original private IP (192.168.1.100:54321).
            Forwards the packet to the appropriate device on the private network.

    tatic NAT (1:1):
        A specific private IP is mapped to a specific public IP.
        Example: 192.168.1.10 → 203.0.113.5 always.
    Dynamic NAT (Many:Many):
        A pool of private IPs is mapped to a pool of public IPs.
        Example: Any device can be dynamically assigned one of several public IPs when connecting to the internet.

Masquerading

    Dynamic NAT for Many:1 Mapping:
        Masquerading is a many-to-one NAT technique where multiple devices share a single public IP.
        Used in home networks or small businesses with one dynamic public IP (like those assigned by ISPs).
