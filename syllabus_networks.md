## **Student Learning Outcomes (Network Programming - CS333)**

The following chart shows alignment between course-specific and program student learning outcomes and program goals.

| Program Goal  | Program Student Learning Outcomes  | Course Learning Objectives  |
|---|---|---|
| To provide knowledge and skills in network programming and communication protocols. | The students completing the course are expected to possess the following skills and abilities: | 1. Theory: Understand fundamental networking concepts such as OSI/TCP-IP models, protocol stack layers, and their roles. |
| | | 2. Theory: Learn about various networking protocols including ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, and their implementations. |
| | 2. Be able to design and develop network applications. | 3. Programming: Implement socket programming in C/C++ for TCP and UDP communication. |
| | 3. Possess skills in debugging and analyzing network traffic. | 4. Tools: Use network debugging tools such as Wireshark, tcpdump, and traceroute. |
| 2. To nurture the professional values of teamwork, integrity, and problem-solving. | | 5. Programming: Develop multithreaded and event-driven network applications. |
| | | 6. Tools: Work with real-world networking scenarios, including NAT traversal, VPNs, and firewalls. |
| | | 7. Security: Understand network security risks and implement basic secure communication practices using TLS and encryption techniques. |
| | | 8. Applied Skills: Design, build, and troubleshoot scalable and efficient network applications. |

**Make-up Procedures:**

Students are required to take tests, exams and quizzes when they are scheduled by the instructor. In the event that a student misses a test, exam or quiz, the instructor is under no obligation to give a make-up, unless the student brings convincing, objective evidence that it was impossible for the student to take it at the scheduled time due to a medical or other emergency. Students should give instructors written notice of any absences from tests, exams or quizzes BEFORE the test, exam or quiz. In the event of an unscheduled quiz, the student should have a good reason for absence. If there is no good reason for the absence, it is up to the instructor to decide how or whether to give a make-up exam or take into account the missing work when calculating the final grade.

**Library and Media/Technology Use**

To enhance their overall learning in the course, students are strongly encouraged to use supplemental online and reference materials available in the library.

**Policy on Grade Appeal**

Students are entitled to appeal grades in line with the universityâ€™s Grades Policies policy which is available online at [http://policies.aua.am](http://policies.aua.am)

**Standards for Academic Integrity**

Students are required to conduct themselves in an academically responsible and ethical manner in line with the Student Code of Ethics. Acts of academic dishonesty impair the academic integrity of AUA and create an unfair academic advantage for the student involved and other member(s) of the academic community. These acts are subject to disciplinary measures as prescribed in the AUA Code of Student Ethics [http://policies.aua.am/policy/10](http://policies.aua.am/policy/10)

The Student Code of Conduct can be found at [http://policies.aua.am/policy/101](http://policies.aua.am/policy/101)


**Special Needs:**
Students requiring special accommodations for learning should contact the Center for Student Success by the end of the Drop/Add period with such requests. studentsuccess@aua.am, [http://studentsuccess.aua.am/disability-support-services/](http://studentsuccess.aua.am/disability-support-services/)
